# Bachelor Final Year Project
Module based game engine

Dream project of creating a game engine.
The plan to make an old-school like game engine that connects the framework API and a seperate editor application.

The editor is made using the engine's API. It's purpose is to edit any visual aspects of the game with ease.
It is to assint in building the world, setting up object placement, adjusting lighting, adjusting particle, etc.
All will then be saved into a file which will be loaded during the game's runtime.

The framework is pure. Unlike modern game engines that drops you at the game loop. You start with the main function and build everything yourself.
You determine what is needed, how it is used, what the structure flow is, and weather it is threaded.
All is in your control. And that's where modules come in.

Modules is a big focus. Each components and aspects of the game engine will be made as a module.
Modules are made having low-level control, clean and lean, high level usage, and modularity in mind.
They are to be used like plug-ins, think of making a structure using Legos where each Lego blocks are different modules.
So no bloat and unnecessary dependencies, use what you need and nothing more.

That's all, say hi Ho Saing!
